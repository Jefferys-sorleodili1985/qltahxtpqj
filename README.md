Wow...I just walked out of the theater and my mind is kind of spinning, y'know? Hurry Up Tomorrow was like...this whirlwind. Imagine mayonnaise on toast with glitter sprinkled in—unexpectedly strange but also kind of fascinating.

The theater was a zoo, popcorn stuck all over my jeans, and why are those seats so unbelievably uncomfortable? I swear my back feels like a question mark right now. Ugh.

Oh right, the movie...the opening scene just, BAM, hits you with this kaleidoscope of colors. It's like they filmed inside a washing machine with all the mismatched socks going round and round forever. And the main characters, wow, they were... umm, they felt like my old college roomies, spontaneous disaster specialists.

> Gosh, there was so much noise. I could barely hear the dialog over all the munching and slurping, and that one person behind me who seemed to be speaking fluent dialect of Coughinese.

One scene had these squirrels running around like they're late for a very important date—Alice in Wonderland style, but with more nuts and less, like, existential dread. Or maybe not. Kind of lost track there for a bit.

Remember to download the movie later—or was it watch the movie, lol—just because it's worth seeing again to maybe, hopefully, understand it afterward? Or maybe it’s just for background noise when you’re trying to nap on a lazy afternoon.

The climax happened somewhere between my phone buzzing and an obnoxiously loud sneeze from six seats behind. Something about a giant clock? Honestly, it was more surreal than that dream I had after eating way too much cheese last Tuesday.

In any case, no sense really trying to piece it all together. Might just make more sense if watched backwards while humming Bohemian Rhapsody. Would recommend, I think? If life's feeling too real, jump into this one; it's a refreshing splash of nonsensical cold soda right to the face.

All right, my fingers are getting tired. Gotta head home before my brain starts leaking out my ears. 

```cpp
int main() {
    // why is there a loop with no break...?
    int cheese = 42;
    while (true) {
        cout << Squirrel
;
    }
    return pizza; // gah, what's even happening here...
}
```

Catch you later!
